Overview
===================

After :doc:`installing ship_mapper <installation>`, you'll need to:

#. Create several new directories named ``data``, ``grids`` and ``projects`` (see more :doc:`HERE <directory_structure>`)
#. Place your data in the ``data`` directory
#. Create a ``grids`` directory and make a few "grids" for later use in your projects  
#. Make a ``projects`` directory...
#. Create a ``settings.py`` file and save it in the ``projects`` directory (see more :doc:`HERE <settings>`)
#. Each new project will need its own directory under the ``projects`` directory. All output will be written here. 
#. Also within each project directory you will need to have at least one ``run`` file where you'll write the commands to process and plot your data

You can see a basic explanation of the different proceeses you can do with 
``ship_mapper`` in the "USER GUIDE" section. Also you can see the :doc:`Examples <examples>`.

You can also see the :doc:`API <api>` section for a list of all functions of `ship_mapper`.
